There have been many sermons preached and books written on various subjects; but no matter what the titles are and however many angles from which they came, the underlying teaching is a focus on sins and the warnings against falling into them. More often than not, Romans 6:1 is used as the basis for such teaching: <em>"What shall we say then? Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase?"</em>
