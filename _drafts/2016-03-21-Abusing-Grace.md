There have been many sermons preached and books written on various subjects; but no matter what the titles are and however many angles from which they came, the underlying teaching is a focus on sins and the warnings against falling into them. More often than not, Romans 6:1 is used as the basis for such teaching: <em>"What shall we say then? Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase?"</em>

There is clearly an assumption that the majority of Christians needs to be reminded that they should not abuse God's grace as demonstrated in the amount of sermons and writings. This article attempts to show that such warnings are both misplaced and show perhaps a lack of the knowledge of God's grace on the part of the writers or preachers.

## As false assumption

Do people really need to know God's grace before they can start taking advantage of it? If it is true that people do take advantage of God's grace, then the world may be better of without Christianity, because they would not have known God's grace and will not be able to abuse it, to find a license to sin. Of course we all know that people sinned way before they knew of the concept of God's grace. How much did man sin before God sent the great flood?

We've heard many testimonies and stories of changed lives, of those who led such a lives controlled by sins and changed for the better. If these testimonies are true, and if these positive stories of changed lives are reliable, then what is the rationale for such teaching? What necessitates the constant preaching against the abusing of God's grace which defies the very guarantee of God that <em>"He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus" (Philippians 1:6)</em>?

## The contradictions

Before the preachers of "Do not abuse God's grace" can start worrying about folks taking advantage of it, they must have succeeded in planting a seed of faith in God such that their listeners are fully convicted that God's forgiveness through the cross can cover their multitude of sins.

If they had not succeeded in doing so, there's no point worrying about their abusing of God's grace, because how can someone who does not have the assurance of salvation do the very thing they're being accused of?

In the book "The Grace Awakening," Charles Swindoll asserted if you don't preach grace until you're accused of giving people a license to sin, you haven't preached anything of great value at all. The great preacher Martyn L. Jones also wrote virtually the same thing years before C. Swindoll of the very same thing. But both these men simply recapitulated what the apostle Paul wrote in Romans of accusation against him preaching too much of God's grace: <em>"What shall we say then? Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase?"</em>, to which he responded <em>"Absolutely not."</em>

In reality, a survey of all material ever written through the ages shows a disproportionate focus on sins, not grace. Therefore we can safely assert that the "do not abuse God's grace" type of preaching is not based on the true state of faith of believers at all.
