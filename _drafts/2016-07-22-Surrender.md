A quick survey on the Internet with a search engine query: "The Art of Surrender" reveals an overwhelming amount of material on the subject. This article uses the same search term in its meta description to see how well it will do in terms of search engine ranking. Which ones among myriad sources might provide the seekers with something that works? I was one such seeker as early as the teen years when adulthood was fast approaching with pensive thoughts of what the future might hold. For a while during this time that I tried yoga with the hope of finding some rest to my soul, the rest that required a degree of surrender.

Then came Trancendental Meditation, then another year-long study of the Bhagavad Gita, followed with passionate peering through Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha earnestly looking for a breakthrough out of the endless cycles of birth and death. It was a longing for a surrender, an ability to make peace with one's existence. No such luck. Just like Siddhartha who would wake up from a period of meditation to find himself still caught in the cycle with no end in sight.

Paul declared a statement of fact concerning the reality of our fleshly existence:

> For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would (Galatians 5:17).

If the flesh desires not the things of God, it would not surrender to God. It simply won't. It's an inate impossibility. It runs in the veins of the descendants of Eve.

There is no doubt virtually all Christians long to surrender to God so they may experience the rest that Jesus promised to those who come to Him (Matthew 11:28), but they just simply can't. The apostle Paul empathizes with us in our struggle to surrender&mdash;struggle to surrender? What a contradiction!&mdash;
