				An overwhelming majority in Christendom believes that sanctification is a process. This article attempts to show that it is not a process, but a gift. This belief system satisfies the self-centered desire for self exaltation. The believers are not to focus on themselves but to fix their eyes on Christ.

    <p><span class="green-letter">2 Timothy 2:15 says: “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.”</span>  I believe this verse in the King James version is probably the most accurate, at least in the English language.</p>

    <p>The NIV says this: <span class="green-letter">“Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.”</span> This translation though new does not adequately express the meaning of the verse, it makes the diligent study of the Word as just something added on, as if it can be omitted from the verse with minimal impact. The NIV version seems to talk of a person who is approved in the sense of his conducts rather than his approach in Bible Study. The King James’ dependent clause “rightly dividing the word of truth” explains the reason why this workman is approved: how he studies the Word.</p>

    <p>I believe many of us, though believing in the Apostle’s Creed, deviate quite far from it in practice. I believe we have added to it much more than what is written in it. But like believers of other legalistic, karma based, religions—Buddhist, Hindu, etc., we assume these beliefs are the gospel themselves. In the emails that I have started written since Sept 13, 2009, just a few days past exactly two years ago, in an email titled: <em>“A Heart Like Jesus - Max Lucado”</em>, it seemed God had begun in me an unquenchable passion to resolve many of these conflicts: between the gospel that I first heard, and the crazy making beliefs in the years that follow that affect my day to day Christianity. It’s these conflicts that make our Christian lives miserable at best, at worst it could make someone simply leave the faith as it had become a never ending treadmill.</p>

    <p>In this email I want to talk about Sanctification, or Sự Nên Thánh. Most Christians believe that we are first saved—Salvation, then a sanctification process follows. I believe this is not what the Bible teaches. I believe we get it all at once, both salvation and sanctification. But first let’s define sanctification, it’s not important how this word is defined in theological dictionary, it’s just a brain exercise, but it is important how we think about it in church life because that is where the rubber meets the road.</p>

    <p>For most of us, though we have been saved, we still feel we are not good enough, there is more work to be done in order that we become more acceptable to God. And we do this through Scripture study, fasting, fellowship meetings, some adopt cult-liked practices of public sin confession, retreats, seminars, prayers, doing good unto others, washing of feet, volunteering, evangelistic missions, praying in tongues, etc. This is typically how we think sanctification means.</p>

    <p>The rest of the world’s religions also have their own version of sanctification as well. Their goal is to purge themselves of their sinful nature so that ultimately one day they can break free from the cycle of birth and death. They do this through harsh treatment of the bodies, through meditation, through depriving themselves of even physical or emotional needs. And countless methods of discipline to advance themselves to a higher spiritual level.</p>

    <p>In summary, this sanctification process becomes the main focus of religion. Salvation, done. Now sanctification begins. Now purification begins. All faiths, including ours, assume we are perpetually in a state of becoming, of arriving, because we’re not there yet.</p>

    <p>But before I cite Scriptures to prove that this thinking is un-biblical, un-scriptural, and decidedly takes away the glory of the Cross, I’d like us to learn a new word which some of us might be familiar with: Gnosticism. What is gnosticism?</p>

    <p>There was a group of people called the Gnostics who threatened the early church by attempting to reinterpret the teachings of Christ through the lens of their Greek philosophy, and attracted many new believers. Through their unbiblical view of the nature of God, they look at the material world with great suspicion. They believe that <em>“since people are essentially divine souls that are trapped within evil bodies, the goal of life is eventually to escape from our physical bodies and rejoin the high God in the high heavens. Each soul can accomplish this only as it disdains its body by depriving its physical appetites and learns the gnosis, the secret knowledge that shows the path to liberation” (quoted from Michael Wittmer in Heaven Is A Place On Earth).</em></p>

    <p>Doesn’t this sound like Buddhism? or some other Bible based faiths that their devotees are so afraid of any contacts with women? And doesn’t it sound like much of our thinking, too? That all areas of life are basically sinful, only heaven is good, and we use the sanctification process to make ourselves ready for the day we meet our Creator? We think that a day at the park, or in the movie theater, or meal preparation, or washing of a car, is not as spiritual as time spent in the Word. We think that whatever else that is not related to Bible study or prayer or fasting or evangelistic endeavor detracts from our spiritual growth. We might not say it out loud, but isn’t it what we mostly assume to be true? And doesn’t it put some guilt in us if we feel we don’t spend enough time doing spiritual things?</p>

    <p>The apostle Paul was aware of this threat and he at least twice in the Scripture takes straight aim at the incipient Gnosticism and its heretical view of creation. He wrote this to Timothy (1 Tim 4:1-5):</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“<sup>1</sup> The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. <sup>2</sup> Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. <sup>3</sup> They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. <sup>4</sup> For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, <sup>5</sup> because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>and again in Colossians 2:20-23:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“<sup>20</sup> Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world, why, as though you still belonged to it, do you submit to its rules: <sup>21</sup> “Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!”? <sup>22</sup> These are all destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings. <sup>23</sup> Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>What were these people teaching that prompted the apostle Paul to address them with such urgency? They were attempting to “<em>sanctify</em>” themselves through many means that were so appealing to the Christians of his time. Marriage, certain foods, and perhaps other things, somehow divert your attention from what is spiritual. I’m sure Paul wasn’t giving us an exhaustive list of these practices because there were too many. He only addressed practices that were prevalent at the time, and in those churches. My pastor told me of some pastoral retreats that had rituals with candles and quiet times that I felt uneasy about. People are inventive, and like the Isrealites of old, they will come up with myriad ways that supposedly bring them closer to God.</p>

    <p>We call this the sanctification process, that God is still working on us to conform us into the image of Christ. But at the risk of jumping too far ahead, I believe we are fully conformed into the image of Christ when we accept His substitutionary death on the Cross, no more, no less. When God sees us, He sees His Son, His gift of eternal life to us, but not the holiness or goodness that project from ourselves.</p>

    <p>Now I’m claiming that the word sanctification is never meant to be used like this in the Bible. If you do a search, as I searched the King James version in my Kindle, for the word “sanctified”, none came up that suggests “making us more holy”. They all meant “to be set apart”, “biệt riêng ra”, for a particular purpose. And the act of sanctifying something is done by the person who sets the object apart, not the object itself. God sets apart a people for His own purpose, the Levitical priests set apart certain vessels for use in the tabernacles. The purification process, either by God, or by the priests, to prepare the vessels is done by God, or by the priests, but not by the vessels themselves.</p>

    <p>I believe it’s when the vessels that try to purify themselves that they try to become God, that’s when gnosticism is at work, and that is what the apostle Paul is against. Now is the time to quote some from 105 instances of the word “sanctified” in the Bible—pay special attention to the past tense used in all these verses:</p>

    <p class="blockquote">
"And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God." (I Cor 1:2)<br /><br />
"But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God." (1 Cor 6:11)<br /><br />

"...so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’" (Acts 26:15-18) [ we are sanctified by faith, by believing in Jesus ]<br /><br />

"And by that will, we have been sanctified through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all." (Hebrews 10:10) [Wow! Once for all. Francis Schaeffer wrote that you are no more saved, or sanctified, today, or tomorrow, than the day you are saved. How else can you be more sanctified if Christ has already sanctified, or set apart, you? Or are you saying His work is not finished yet?]<br /><br />

"How much more severely do you think a man deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God under foot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified him, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?" (Hebrews 10:29)<br /><br />

"For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified." (Hebrews 10:14) [note that being sanctified here is not a condition upon the recipient of grace, but a fact that since they were sanctified by faith in the Son of God, they are also perfected, for ever]. (Hebrews 10:14)<br /><br />

"Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours" (1 Cor 1:2) [Note that they are not called to become saints in the Catholic point of view—they hope to one day be promoted to sainthood, but here Paul is reminding them of their identity in Christ, as already saints, already sanctified, or set apart as God's people in Christ].
</p>

    <p>Okay, I don’t want to inundate you with another 100 quotes that overwhelmingly demonstrate that our perfect sainthood is already ours in Christ. But to be fair, there is a few instances of “sanctified” that seems to suggest the sanctification process that I’m writing against: one in 2 Tim 2:21 that calls young men to flee from the lust of the flesh, and Romans 12:1 that calls us to present our bodies as living sacrifices, and most if not all instances of the Old Testaments that talks of the people sanctify themselves through means of animal sacrifices. But all these things do nothing to make us more acceptable before God. For New Covenant believers, these exhortations are to the spare the Christians of pain and heartache while they still live in the world; for the Old Covenant folks it’s just a temporary measure until Christ comes.</p>

    <p>So let’s leave out the Old Testament sanctification system, as we now have the perfect sacrificial Lamb of God, how do we deal with the two, out of 105, that suggest we sanctify ourselves by refraining from sinful activities? But do they? No, they don’t make the saints any more saintly than when they first believed, but these verses remind them to live according to their already being set apart as God’s holy vessels.</p>

    <p>I believe when Paul gets down to the specific, he was dealing with specific sins, he did not make sweeping statements for all churches. In some churches, he dealt with legalistic observation of certain religious days, even the Sabbath, some he dealt with the matter of circumcision, some with the problem of gnosticism spreading like wild fire, some with tongue speaking, some for their lack of loving treatments toward the brethrens. In other words he addressed specific issues that a particular church is facing. The rest of his letters are to show the wondrous grace of our Savior Jesus Christ. Remember that the specific issues are far and few in between the proclaiming of God’s good news, or the defense for the faith that was once delivered to the saints against legalism. But as far as I can recall sermons after sermons since I became a Christian some 35 plus years ago, I have never heard an exposition on the “Wonderful grace of Jesus” for any length of time, but the majority I heard was on the unbiblical focus on “sự nên thánh,” on preparing ourselves toward the day of judgement. We are so busy trying to get what that is already ours and neglect to live by the knowledge that we are more than conquerors through Christ. No wonder we have no testimonies.</p>

    <p>I have no problem believing that each Christian should be sensitive to the still small voice of the Holy Spirit as He counsels them in their walk, but I have major problems with making self cleansing, self purging, constant introspection, ritualistic practices, etc., the main focus of our faith. I have problems with us majoring on the two specifically applicable verses and neglect the 103 others that are universally applicable throughout all churches.</p>

    <p>In majoring on the minor, we waste much time correcting ourselves—which only God can do from the inside, and not studying the wonderful power of the gospel, the free gift of salvation.</p>

    <p>Last but not least, how do you think we can sanctify ourselves if we can’t even save ourselves? I believe if it is impossible for us to save ourselves, it is even more impossible for us to adequately sanctify ourselves to make us more acceptable to God? Which is easier: salvation or sanctification—in the sense that there is no longer any flaw found within us, or we become like God? Salvation is much easier, all we need to do is believe. Sanctification, even in the heretical sense stated above, is only possible when God gives us new bodies.</p>

    <p>So I insist that we already have both salvation, and an imparted sanctification that makes us appear blameless before God on the day we received Christ as our Savior. All the work that we erroneously call sanctification is continually done by the indwelling Holy Spirit, mysteriously, by His power, like a fruit showing forth, and the Christian can only be amazed that hither came such wonderful changes in his life. And he does not make a religion out of it. It’s a gift, just like the gift of eternal life. It’s the focus on the gift that makes it a false religion.</p>

    <p>Remember Colossians 2:23 says that disciplines to train oneself toward godliness have an appearance of wisdom but are totally useless in restraining sensual indulgence. This is what all religions pursue but Paul call these are practices taught by deceiving spirits and demons.</p>

    <p>I propose we give thanks to God and live like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, live by faith, rest in the fact that all we need for godliness and contentment is already given us along with Christ, and don’t try anymore to be better than you really are. Because you are already, ALREADY, perfected in Christ. Then we’ll have a testimony.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?” (Romans 8:32)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Everything that I write, came from my deepest desire to experience the rest that we must make every effort to enter into (Heb 4:11), the freedom that Jesus promised (Jn 8:36), the easy yoke and the light burden (Mt 11:30), and the spring of living water that flows into eternal life (Jn 4:14).</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“My people have committed two sins: They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water.” (Jeremiah 2:13)</p>
