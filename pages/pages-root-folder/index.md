  title: "Bible Study"
  url: '/bible-topics/'
  text: 'Studies of various common topics, especially those that tend to be misunderstood and hence misapplied. Don&#39;t accept anything even from the best of teachers as Scriptures, but be like the Bereans to check whatever you hear or read. Check your own interpretation of a passage against all foundational truths you can possibly know, and you will know beyond any doubt its true meaning. In this section you will find the following studies:<br/>1. Galatians<br/>2. Romans<br/>3. The Parables of Jesus, and<br />4. Meditations (thoughts on various topics), and many topics to follow.'

widget3:
  title: "Church Events"
  url: '/blog/'
  text: 'This section documents some special events in the life of our church. Baptism, picnic, camping, retreats, Vacation Bible School, and many others. But like many things that can be captured on camera, they only show superficially the lives of the individuals; their struggles, the unique events in their lives that God uses to build their relationship with Him remain unpsoken. But perhaps these documentaries may serve as landmarks for them in their walk with God.'
