Hi Khuong,

I like you sermons more and more. The sermon last Sunday was uplifting. I liked it a lot.

There is still a fine point I'd like to share with you, though seemingly small, I feel it might run against the grain of the rest of your message. Let's take a look at the passage again:

<p class="blockquote">"And we all, with unveiled faces reflecting the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another, which is from the Lord, who is the Spirit." (2 Cor 3:18)
</p>
