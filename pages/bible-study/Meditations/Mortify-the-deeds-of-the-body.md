teaser: "At first glance, almost without being taught by anyone, most come to the conclusion that to put to death the deeds of the body means to literally pin down and conquer all weaknesses of the flesh. But does the context surrounding this verse warrant such interpretation. This article submits that its true application is not based on our ability, but on what Jesus had accomplished on the cross."

### Is it even possible?

What does it mean to "put to death" the deeds of the flesh? There are probably as many different interpretations and applications as there are religions and spiritual beliefs in the world. The deeds of the flesh are generally associated with sinful activities. Therefore to put them to death means to be no longer affected by sinful temptations such as greed, lust, envy, and many other vices.

Is it realistic for Paul to offer such admonition if the most common interpretation is what he has in mind? Can anyone put to death the deeds of the flesh? Has anyone ever done it? It's a resounding no, because no one has ever done it. Then why did Paul bother to offer such admonition if he knew none of his subjects, including himself, will be able to carry it out?

Most commentaries teach that since now we're empowered by the Holy Spirit, we have the power to put to death the deeds of the flesh. If indeed they had been put to death, there would have been no struggles in the lives of Christians, because who would wrestle with something that is dead? Then Paul wouldn't have written:

<p class="blockquote"><sup>15</sup>For I don't understand what I am doing. For I do not do what I want - instead, I do what I hate.  <sup>16</sup>But if I do what I don't want, I agree that the law is good.  <sup>17</sup>But now it is no longer me doing it, but sin that lives in me.  <sup>18</sup>For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh. For I want to do the good, but I cannot do it.  <sup>19</sup>For I do not do the good I want, but I do the very evil I do not want!  <sup>20</sup>Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer me doing it but sin that lives in me.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><sup>21</sup>So, I find the law that when I want to do good, evil is present with me.  <sup>22</sup> For I delight in the law of God in my inner being.  <sup>23</sup>But I see a different law in my members waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that is in my members.  <sup>24</sup>Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?
<cite>(Romans 7:13-20)</cite></p>

Let us continue looking through this passage in context to get what Paul truly meant.

### Are you allowed to fail this command?

If this command is to be understood in the traditional sense, no one will be saved, because no has ever put to death the deeds of their flesh. Let's read the key verse Romans 8:13 above again: "<cite>For if ye live after the flesh, you shall die</cite>." Even Paul acknowledged that he could not abide by this command in the traditional sense as quoted in Romans 7:13-20 above, therefore what he said in Romans 8:13 must be understood from a different perspective.

Perhaps here's a good place to point you to an earlier article which explains the expression <em>"after the flesh"</em> in the first part of Romans 8:13: "<a style="font-style: italic;" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/walk-according-to-the-flesh/">Walk According to the Flesh.</a>" In short, this article shows that walking after the flesh is not the following of a sinful lifestyle, but it is the use of fleshly efforts to accomplish the things of God. As a matter of fact, this walking after the flesh may even be considered noble and praiseworthy. All of Paul's major epistles were written to steer folks from using their flesh to serve God. The natural outworking of fallen flesh resulting in sinful actions is obvious and doesn't need great spiritual insight to identify, but the use of the flesh to attain spiritual perfection, or to achieve God's righteousness, is universally attractive and ultimately embraced by many. Most folks fail to grasp this warning by Paul and are consequently driven toward the very thing they should avoid: using their flesh to serve God.

So then are you allowed to fail this command&mdash;if it is understood in the traditional sense? No, because "if ye live after the flesh, you shall die" as read in the key verse of this article. This is a great dilemma because you know you cannot help walking after the flesh to a certain degree, and James 2:10 says that if you keep the whole law but fail against one point, you failed the entire law. 

### How to put to death the deeds of the flesh

Paul does show us how to pass from death to life: by putting to death the deeds of the flesh, or the body. But is this really good news, because it sounds no different from the first part of the verse? How do you put to death, or mortify, the deeds of the flesh? Everyone who still lives in the flesh will walk by the flesh, and no one who is still alive can put to death the deeds of his flesh.

And yet we know we're already dead, hence the deeds of our flesh are already dead. 

> <sup>3</sup> Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his <u>death</u>?  <sup>4</sup> Therefore we are <u>buried</u> with him by baptism into death (Romans 6:3-4)

Though we're not practically dead, we're counted as dead by the virtue of Christ's substitutionary death on the cross. There are so many spiritual blessings that became ours through Christ including being dead and buried with Him.

In Romans 7, Paul used an example of a married woman, who is released from the law that bound her to her husband upon his death, to show how a person in Christ can be released from the law that bound him to his body of death (Romans 7:6). Romans 6:6 says "*For he that is dead is freed from sin*," therefore the law in the key verse of this article is fulfilled in him:

<p class="blockquote">For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die, but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</p>

Christ died to fulfill for us the requirements of this law, or command, that would have been impossible for anyone born of flesh and blood to fulfill.

### You must live by grace

The irony here is Paul is writing this important doctrine to the church of Christ as if they're still unbelievers, because the question of life or death is still posed to them. This is a different form of John 3:16 which is accepted as a an invitation to unbelievers. Romans 8:13 is posed to believers who pays lips service to the John 3:16 faith, but in reality still trust in the work of their flesh to earn God's favor.

To these folks, when posed the command in Romans 8:13, they responded in a similar pattern as Nicodemus when Jesus posed to him: "*You must be born again (John 3:1-21)*." Just as Nicodemus could not have been born again through the flesh, they would not have been able to refrain from walking in the flesh, and neither can they put to death the deeds of their flesh. If it took the power of the Spirit of God to born Nicodemus from above spiritually, it would also take the power of the Spirit of God to give the New Covenant Christians a freedom from the deeds of their flesh. But it cannot be understood as the Holy Spirit helps them to perform this miraculous deed, He does it all by Himself without our help, much like when He breathed life into the lump of clay which became Adam.

In summary, to put to death the deeds of the flesh is to refrain from using the flesh to attain God's righteousness.

Paul expressed this doctrine in a different form when he wrote to the Galatians who tied circumcision to their salvation:

> <sup>1</sup>For freedom Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not be subject again to the yoke of slavery.  <sup>2</sup>Listen! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you at all!  <sup>3</sup>And I testify again to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law.  <sup>4</sup>You who are trying to be declared righteous by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace!  <sup>5</sup>For through the Spirit, by faith, we wait expectantly for the hope of righteousness.  <sup>6</sup>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision carries any weight - the only thing that matters is faith working through love. (Galatians 5:1-6)
