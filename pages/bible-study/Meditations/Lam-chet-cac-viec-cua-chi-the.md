## Hai cái nhìn về xác thịt và việc làm của nó

<div>

<img alt src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/death-deeds.jpg" style="border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 136px; padding: 0px; float: left;">
Ấn tượng đầu tiên của bạn là gì khi nói đến xác thịt và các việc làm của nó? Cách giải thich phổ thông nhất của những từ này là xác thịt thì liên hệ đến phần tội lỗi của một người, và các việc làm của xác thịt là những việc làm đến từ các phần tội lỗi đó. Bài viết này đề nghị một cái nhìn đúng với Kinh Thánh hơn đối với những từ đó. Bài này quả quyết rằng sứ đồ Phao-lô viết để cảnh cáo sự dùng việc làm của xác thịt để nâng cao đời sống tâm linh. Để dễ dàng cho việc thảo luận, chúng ta đặt tên cho hai quan niệm: "cách nhìn phổ thông," và "cách nhìn chân thực."
</p>
</div>

## Theo cách nhìn phổ thông

Nếu cách nhìn phổ thông quả thực đúng với dụng ý của Phao-lô, thì người tín hữu có hy vọng gì? Vì có ai mà không sống theo xác thịt, không nhiều thì ít? Làm sao một người tín hữu trung bình có thể biết mình có đang sống, và sống bao nhiêu, dưới ảnh hưởng của xác thịt?

Tôi đã tốn 30 năm đầu kể từ khi tin Chúa tìm cách để đừng sống dưới sự kềm toả của xác thịt. Nghe biết bao nhiêu bài giảng, rồi nhiều thập niên trôi qua mà chẳng có hy vọng gì làm cho chết những việc của xác thịt. Những buổi bồi linh chỉ khơi dậy trong chốc lát đốm lửa gần tàn như vinh hiển Đức Chúa Trời đang phai dần trên khuôn mặt Môi-se khi ông rời sự hiện diện vinh hiển của Ngài. Đôi khi tôi thầm nương dựa nơi sự khích lệ của người khác để được vững tâm phần nào rằng mình cũng thiêng liêng đến mức, khi khác thì cậy nơi tình cảm riêng mình khi xét lòng thấy mình cũng đạt đến một mức nào đó. Nhưng nếp sống như vậy thì trái nghịch lại với sự biết chắc vững vàng như được bày tỏ trong Hebrews 11:1.

<p class="blockquote">Vả, đức tin là sự biết chắc vững vàng của những điều mình đương trông mong là bằng cớ của những điều mình chẳng xem thấy.</p>

### <span style="color: #666666;">Chúng ta phải cố gắng hết sức mình</span>

Có thể có người sẽ nói: Phải, mặc dầu chúng ta không thể nào hoàn toàn làm chết được các việc làm của xác thịt, chúng ta vẫn phải cố gắng hết sức mình. Nhưng đây là sự tự dối mình, vì Romans 8:13 tuyên bố rõ ràng rằng *"nếu anh em sống theo xác thịt thì phải chết."* Do đó dù chỉ một chút xác thịt ở một nơi hoặc lúc nào đó cũng đủ để khiến bạn bị loại trừ trong nước Đức Chúa Trời, vì có chép trong James 2:10 rằng: *"Vì người nào giữ trọn luật pháp, mà phạm một điều răn, thì cũng đáng tội như đã phạm hết thảy."* Do đo theo cái nhìn phổ thông thì bạn phải làm cho chết hết mọi việc của chi thể.

Hơn nữa dù có cố gắng hết sức cũng không đủ, vì nếu đủ, thì hẳn Chúa Giê-su đã không phải chết trên thập tự giá. Chúa đã phải hi sinh để tháo gỡ nanh vuốt của xác thịt bạn hầu bạn có thể hầu việc và thờ phượng Ngài. Nhưng chính sự giải thoát đó cũng giới hạn trong mối liên hệ đến sự sống đời đời, không phải cho xác thịt này mà bạn phải nhẫn nại chịu đựng cho đến ngày được ban cho thân thể không hay hư nát. Nếu bạn phải làm chết mọi công việc của xác thịt trong ý nghĩa bạn không còn phạm tội nữa thì chắc chắn bạn không thể nào có hy vọng về sự sống đời đời.

Tôi có câu hỏi cho quí vị giữ cái nhìn phổ thông là tại sao quí vị lại khăng khăng giữ lấy sự tin tưởng vào một hệ thống tín lý mà chắc chắn bạn sẽ bị khước từ trước ngưỡng cửa thiên đàng?

### <span style="color: #666666;">Các sách giải kinh nói gì?</span>

Hầu như tất cả các sách giải kinh dạy rằng

Virtually all commentaries teach that since now we're empowered by the Holy Spirit, we have the power to put to death the deeds of the flesh&mdash;sinful deeds, according to the traditional view.

Let us consider a few commentaries which hold the traditional view on Romans 8:13.

#### Matthew Henry
<p class="blockquote"> If any habitually live according to <u>corrupt lusting</u>s, they will certainly perish in their sins, whatever they profess. And what can a <u>worldly life</u> present, worthy for a moment to be put against this noble prize of our high calling? Let us then, by the Spirit, endeavour more and more to <u>mortify the flesh</u>.</p>

#### Gill

Gill wrote a very long winded exposition on this verse, but the bottom line is it is based on the premise of the traditional view of the flesh in this verse.

#### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown

<p class="blockquote">The apostle is not satisfied with assuring them that they are under no obligations to the flesh, to hearken to its suggestions, without reminding them where it will end if they do; and he uses the word "mortify" (put to death) as a kind of play upon the word "die" just before. "If ye do not <u>kill sin</u>, it will kill you."</p>

My thought: can you really kill sin? The only one who can kill sin is Christ, and the only thing you can do is helplessly rest on Him.

#### Ellicott

<p class="blockquote">If under the influence of the Spirit you <u>reduce to a condition of deadness and atrophy</u> all those practices to which <u>the impulses of your material nature</u> would prompt you.</p>

Spurious argument at best. What is a condition of deadness and atrophy? By whose standard? Your own arbitrary perception of deadness and atrophy?

#### Barnes

<p class="blockquote">If you live to <u>indulge your carnal propensitie</u>s, you will sink to eternal death ... The deeds of the body - The <u>corrupt inclinations and passions</u>; called deeds of the body, because they are supposed to have their origin in the <u>fleshly appetites</u>.</p>

Didn't this commentator read Colossians 2:16-23?

#### Matthew Poole

<p class="blockquote">The godly themselves need this caution; they must not think, that because they are elected and justified, &c., that therefore they may do and live as they list. </p>

#### Cambridge

<p class="blockquote">put to death; an antithesis to the “death” just mentioned as the result of sin. The verb is in the present tense, and indicates a continued process of <u>resistance and self-denial</u>. ... This passage, and the parallels, shew how fully St Paul recognized the element of sinfulness as present still in the regenerate—so present as to call for <u>intense resistance</u>. </p>

This is all I gathered in one Internet query. I presume the rest of commentaries commit the same isogesis as these we've read.

The Bible commentators are guilty of asking others to do what they themselves cannot do. Didn't Jesus say something about this concerning the teachers of the law? But it doesn't matter what the commentaries say, each one of us is accountable for making sure we're not in error in approaching this important concept because it profoundly affects our relationship with God. Who can verify that someone's flesh is indeed mortified? Can each one who holds the traditional view verify for himself he fully passes the mortification test? 

### <span style="color: #666666;">Running without aim</span>

So far we have presented the case that there is no hope of heaven for those who hold the traditional view. The first part of Romans 8:13 which says *"if you live after the flesh you will die"* virtually condemned all of mankind because all who inherit fallen humanity live after the flesh. But here's what the Bible say about your ability to slay your flesh:

<p class="blockquote">All have sinned and fallen short of God's glory <cite>(Romans 3:23)</cite></p>

<p class="blockquote">All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. <cite>(Isaiah 53:6; Romans 3:10-18)</cite></p>

So we must be deluding ourselves if we thing we can put to death the deeds of the flesh according to the traditional view. Are we like folks who try to finish the race knowing that we can't win? The appalling thing is pulpits all over the world is preaching the tradition view as if it is the main purpose of Christianity. It is converting folks to embark on a quest to a country surrounded with barbed wires no one can enter.

### <span style="color: #666666;">Who wrestles with dead flesh?</span>

If indeed the deeds of the flesh could be put to death, then there would be no longer any struggles in the lives of Christians, wouldn't there? And who would want to wrestle with something that is dead? And if the flesh can be put to death physically, then Paul wouldn't have written:

<p class="blockquote"><sup>21</sup>So, I find the law that when I want to do good, evil is present with me.  <sup>22</sup>For I delight in the law of God in my inner being.  <sup>23</sup>But I see a different law in my members waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that is in my members. <cite>(Romans 7:21-23)</cite></p>

## The biblical, and correct, view

What is the Bible about? Is it a book of morality to deal with Man's countless vices? Or is it one to bridge the impossible chasm between God and Man? Indeed though it started out showing Man's utter depravity by showing their uncountable acts that came from the deepest parts of their fallen humanity, it moved on to the triumphant declaration, not of anyone of flesh and blood, but of the Son of God as their Savior.

The Bible, in the part we called the Old Testament, gave mankind for a limitted time a chance to go through a test, through the Old Covenant with the ten commandments and statutes, with the ultimate goal of bringing them to a place where they're on their knees realizing that no matter how much they try with their flesh, by doing something, or avoid doing something else, by using the ten commandments and various Mosaic laws and statutes as their moral yardsticks, they would still fall far short of God's standard of righteousness.

And after a time of letting Man exhaust all their resources, after they failed miserably in trying to keep the commandments, God ushered in a new era that no longer allows Man to try to test their worth through their self effort, their flesh. This new era is recorded in the New Testament in which faith is now the sole instrument through which men can receive the gift of the forgiveness of sins and eternal life free to anyone who asks.

Jesus had come two thousands years ago as foretold by prophets long ago, but most importantly He came to end all sacrifices (Hebrews 10:12;10:26), and claimed supremacy as the sole Savior of mankind. His sacrifice will end all sacrifices. He is the gospel, the Word of God, with nothing to be added or taken away from it.

Mankind is expected to stop all their trying, because the time has passed for them to try with their own self effort, because they had been proven incapable of saving themselves, now they must surrender and express their trust completely on Jesus who came as their Savior. No longer are they allowed to use the power of their flesh to prove their worth before God, which really is no more than filthy rags. But we shall see that their pride is great, and they will try with all their might to prove once again they are "like God, knowing good and evil." And Paul was tasked with the job of writing to the churches to tell them that now is the time for faith, no longer for works. This is the deeds of the flesh that they must put to death; it is this kind of deeds that compete with the cross of Christ in the salvation of their souls. The sinful deeds of their flesh can be forgiven, but these cross-defying deeds from their flesh is an abormination to the Lord.

### <span style="color: #666666;">Let's learn some Greek</span>

The word "deeds" in this Romans 8:13 verse is keyed to the Strong number 4234:

<p class="blockquote"><cite>4234: praxis prax'-is from 4238; practice, i.e. (concretely) an act; by extension, a function:--deed, office, work. see GREEK for 4238</cite>
</p>

with a corresponding verb with Strong number 4238:

<p class="blockquote">
<cite>4238: 4238 prasso pras'-so a primary verb; to "practise", i.e. <u>perform repeatedly or habitually</u> (thus differing from 4160, which properly refers to a single act); by implication, to execute, accomplish, etc.; specially, to collect (dues), fare (personally):--commit, deeds, do, exact, keep, require, use arts.</cite>
</p>

A survey of the Greek word number 4238 through various uses of it in the Bible shows its neutral meaning, of actions that are not necessarily good or bad, of action, performance, execution, accomplishment, etc. depending on context.

We tend to associate the "deeds of the flesh" to sinful actions, but we fail to see it in context of the whole reason why Paul writes this letter, he writes about the use of the flesh in trying to excel spiritually.

### <span style="color: #666666;">The Cross wasn't enough</span>

Soon after Jesus was resurrected and went to sit at the right hand of God to bestow righteousness upon those who called on His name, and soon after the first church of Jesus Christ was established as recorded in the book of Acts, the Christians of this first church retreated back to the old way. So much so that Paul had to begin to write profusely many letters to call them to stay true to the gospel of Jesus Christ.

#### To the church in Colosse

Paul started out chapter 2 of Colossians  with a wish that

<p class="blockquote">"<sup>2</sup>their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the <u>full assurance of understanding</u>, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and <u>of Christ;  <sup>3</sup>In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge</u>." <cite>(Colossians 2:2-3)</cite></p>

Paul reminded them that whatever they needed for godliness and contentment is hidden in Christ. It's evident in succeeding passages where we will soon read that they try to find them within themselves&mdash;the deeds of their flesh.

<p class="blockquote"><sup>6</sup>Therefore, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him,  <sup>7</sup>rooted and built up in him and firm in your faith just as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.<cite>(Colossians 2:6-7)</cite></p>

He assured them that the simple gospel they received in the beginning as expressed in John 3:16 is the same one for them to live by.

<p class="blockquote"><sup>8</sup>Be careful not to allow anyone to captivate you through an empty, deceitful philosophy that is according to human traditions and the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ. <cite>(Colossians 2:8)</cite></p>

Paul continued with further warning about people with convincing arguments urging them to add their flesh works based on human traditions. In other words, they minimize the saving power of the cross of Christ.

<p class="blockquote">In him you also were circumcised - not, however, with a circumcision performed by human hands, but by the removal of the fleshly body, that is, through the circumcision done by Christ. <cite>(Colossians 2:11)</cite></p>

One deed of the flesh that the Colossians must put to death is their reliance on the circumcision of their flesh. It is in direct competition with the circumcision in the heart by Christ.

<p class="blockquote"><sup>20</sup>If you have died with Christ to the elemental spirits of the world, why do you submit to them as though you lived in the world?  <sup>21</sup>"Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!"  <sup>22</sup>These are all destined to perish with use, founded as they are on human commands and teachings.  <sup>23</sup>Even though they have the appearance of wisdom with their self-imposed worship and false humility achieved by an <u>unsparing treatment</u> of the body - a wisdom with no true value - they in reality result in <u>fleshly indulgence</u>. <cite>(Colossians 2:20-23)</cite>
</p>

The elemental spirits of the world has a lot to do with encouraging the deeds of the flesh as pseudo spiritualism; looks and sounds so noble, embraced by all the venerable commentators I listed above, and major denominations with their well learned leaders of advanced theological degrees. How can these great men commit such egregious error in Bible interpretation? It is not about using the flesh for sinning, it's about using the flesh for supposedly noble spiritual purpose.

Note also that the Cambridge commentary quoted above expressed the virtue of "intense resistence and self denial" which in reality produced "fleshly indulgence" as we read in Colossians 2:23. These are deeds of the flesh cloaked in noble sounding pious platitude.

#### To the church in Galatia

Paul expressed this doctrine in a different form when he wrote to the Galatians who tied circumcision to their salvation:

<p class="blockquote"><sup>1</sup>For freedom Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not be subject again to the yoke of slavery.  <sup>2</sup>Listen! I, Paul, tell you that <u>if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you at all!</u>  <sup>3</sup>And I testify again to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law.  <sup>4</sup><u>You who are trying to be declared righteous by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace!</u>  <sup>5</sup>For through the Spirit, by faith, we wait expectantly for the hope of righteousness.  <sup>6</sup>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision carries any weight - the only thing that matters is faith working through love. (Galatians 5:1-6)</p>

Paul wrote the entire book of Galatians with the express purpose of calling them to stop relating to God through legalistic lawkeeping which has much to do with the flesh. Galatians 5:1-6 quoted above demonstrate the real meaning of the "deeds of the flesh" in the form of circumcision which Paul denounced with no uncertain terms: *"if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you at all!"* and *"You who are trying to be declared righteous by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace!"*. This *deed of the flesh* of trying to achieve God's righteousness through the work of the flesh is <u>the unforgivable sin</u>.

#### To the church in Rome

<p class="blockquote"><sup abp="1961">1</sup>Brothers and sisters, my heart's desire and prayer to God on behalf of my fellow Israelites is for their salvation. &nbsp;<sup>2</sup>For I can testify that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not in line with the truth. &nbsp;<sup>3</sup>For <u>ignoring the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking instead to establish their own righteousness</u>, they did not submit to God's righteousness. &nbsp;<sup>4</sup>For Christ is the end of the law, with the result that there is righteousness for everyone who believes.&nbsp;<cite>(Romans 10:1-4)</cite></p>

Where else but from the flesh that self righteousness came? This is a sin not of human frailty but of pride. The kind of deeds that are not common preached against from pulpits, but those that inhabit the hearts of preachers themselves, of great theologians who failed at the very basic rule of reasoning.

#### Letter to the Hebrews

In chapter 8, the author of the book of Hebrews, after carefully laying the foundation, began to introduce Jesus as the minister of a superior ministry of a better covenant.

<p class="blockquote">But now Jesus has obtained a <u>superior ministry</u>, since the covenant that he mediates is also better and is enacted on <u>better promises</u>. <cite>(Hebrews 8:6)</cite></p>

The old and inferior covenant was based entirely on the deeds, or works, of the flesh, but the new and superior covenant is based on faith (Galatians 3:12).

#### Nicodemus and the deeds of the flesh

When Jesus declared this truth to Nicodemus: "*You must be born again (John 3:1-21)*," he could not help but thinking in flesh terms: should I be born again by going back into my mother's womb? Of course, this thought came only as a response to Jesus' puzzling statement, but Nicodemus was more familiar with other deeds of the flesh not dissimilar to those of the Colossians or the Galatians, or any Hebrews who were steeped in the Old Covenant.

#### The vain glory of the lawkeepers

As a matter of fact, this walking after the flesh may even be considered noble and praiseworthy. The natural outworking of fallen flesh resulting in sinful actions is obvious and doesn't need great spiritual insight to identify, but the use of the flesh to attain spiritual perfection, or to achieve God's righteousness, is universally attractive and ultimately embraced by many. Most folks fail to grasp this warning by Paul and are consequently driven toward the very thing they should avoid: using their flesh to serve God.

## In Conclusion

The Bible is repleted with examples of folks using their flesh not as instruments for sin, but as means to draw near to God. I hope that this writing helps folks who struggle with the traditional view of the deeds of the flesh understand that it is God's will for them to embrace the infinitely more correct view of the concept in question and get some relief, and walk with lighter steps toward the day they meet God with full confidence that God requires nothing but a childlike faith in Jesus.

> <sup>28</sup>Therefore they said to Him, "What shall we do, so that we may work the works of God?" <sup>29</sup>Jesus answered and said to them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent."
