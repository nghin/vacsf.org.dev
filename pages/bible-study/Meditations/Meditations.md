      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/missing-gods-grace/">Missing God's Grace&mdash;<cite>Galatians 5:4</cite></a><p style="font-weight: normal;">
Have you always lived the Christian life like walking a tightrope? One misstep and down you go. Though you might be blessed with a faith to believe that Jesus will not let you fall forever into your death, it is the constant fear of falling that makes for a very lethargic and powerless journey into eternity. Knowing the real cause of the falling from God's grace will give you Jesus' promised peace that passes understanding.
      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/suffer-with-christ/">Suffering with Christ&mdash;<cite>Romans 8:16-17</cite></a><p style="font-weight: normal;">
Christianity does not have a monopoly when it comes to suffering as a means for higher spirituality. The virtue of self sacrifice is exalted in virtually all religions. Concerning Christianity, what does the Bible say about suffering?

      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/deliberate-sinning/">Deliberate sinning&mdash;<cite>Hebrews 10:26-27</cite></a><p style="font-weight: normal;">
What sin is written about in <cite>Hebrews 10:26-27</cite>? The common transgressions that good Christians should avoid at all cost? Or something specific that warrants such stern warning? This writing proposes that the deliberate sinning addressed in this passage is not about sins in general, but about a specific sin that calls for God's judgement, and a fury of fire, the sin that makes one an enemy of God.

      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/the-enabling-grace/">Enabling Grace&mdash;A rock climbing illustration of the power of God's amazing grace</a><p style="font-weight: normal;">
A rock climbing event gave us an amazing illustration of the freeing power of God's unbreakable grace. Until the full knowledge of God's grace (<cite>2 Peter 3:18</cite>) is realized in a person's heart, he/she cannot rightly relate to God, cannot worship, cannot serve, everything is a fearful duty. But when His love is unleashed, he/she will ascend to the top.

      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/put-to-death-the-deeds-of-the-body/">Putting to Death the Deeds of the Flesh - Làm Cho Chết Các Việc Của Chi Thể</a><p style="font-weight: normal;">
      
At first glance, almost without being taught by anyone, most come to the conclusion that to put to death the deeds of the body means to literally pin down and conquer all weaknesses of the flesh. But does the context surrounding this verse warrant such interpretation? This article submits that the deeds of the flesh that must be put to death are not sins common to man, but are those that presume to bring man closer to God, to excel spiritually&mdash;it is religion.<span style="color: #cc0000; font-style: italic;"> (Bài này có tiếng Việt)</span>

      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/ambassador/">Parable of the Ambassador - Ngụ Ngôn Quan Khâm Sai</a><p style="font-weight: normal;">

This parable tells of an ambassador who made the fatal mistake of distorting the message of reconciliation he received from his king to an enemy he intends to bring back into the fold<span style="color: #cc0000; font-style: italic;"> (Bài này có tiếng Việt)</span>

</p></li>
      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/grieving-holy-spirit/">Grieving the Holy Spirit - Làm Buồn Đức Thánh Linh</a><p style="font-weight: normal;">

Will the Holy Spirit leave you if you grieve Him? Will you lose your salvation? <span style="color: #cc0000; font-style: italic;">(Bài này có tiếng Việt)</span>

</p></li>
      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/baptism/">Baptism</a><p style="font-weight: normal;">

A more complete picture of baptism. This article points out the historical roots; considers the specific audiences to which the messengers were sent; and identifies where baptism fits into our Christian lives.

</p></li>
      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/rewards/">Rewards - Phần Thưởng Trên Trời</a><p style="font-weight: normal;">

Are there degrees of rewards in heaven? This article will show that the very idea is a worldly one, but it is at the core of work-based religion <span style="font-style: italic; color: #d30015;">(bài này có tiếng Việt)</span>

</p></li>
      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/christ-in-me/">The Hope of Glory</a><p style="font-weight: normal;">

The 10 commandments, the law, works, grace ... how are we to live? Perhaps this article doesn't even need to be written. All the answers are found in the studies of Romans and Galatians.

</p></li>
      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/sanctification/">Sanctification</a><p style="font-weight: normal;">

An overwhelming majority in Christendom believes that sanctification is a process. This article attempts to show that it is not a process, but a gift. This belief system satisfies the self-centered desire for self exaltation. The believers are not to focus on themselves but to fix their eyes on Christ.

</p></li>
      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/the-cycle/">The Faith-Salvation-Work Cycle</a><p style="font-weight: normal;">

The dangerous cycle based on circular reasoning what wrecks lives of those naively follow it. Salvation is based on faith in Christ with no strings attached, no small prints, no disclaimers. As dangerous as it is, like the little yeast of the Pharisees that can spoil the whole batch of dough, it is widely accepted and taught everywhere.

</p></li>
      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bible-topics/meditations/lukewarm/">Laodicea, are you lukewarm?</a><p style="font-weight: normal;">

This article will show that the commonly accepted interpretation of lukewarmness is unbiblical, it tends to be used as a scare tactic to keep believers in line. There is a correct interpretation of it that is based entirely on foundational truths found in the Bible.
