Do not be quick with your mouth, do not be hasty in your heart to utter anything before God. God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few (<cite>Ecclesiastes 5:2</cite>). Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said, \"Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?\" (<cite>Job 38:2-3</cite>)"

Though this article is about prayer, its goal is to take the eyes of the one who prays away from himself, from the objects of his prayer, or even the technicalities, the how-to's of the prayer itself, and focus them on the Person to whom he prays.

There seems to be a consensus that a good thing came about, someone was healed, found a job, disaster averted, because there was someone who prayed. In our house there is a wood carving which says "Prayer Changes Things." Many books are written with annecdotes of miraculous things that happened because of prayers. These stories became the mountain peak of experience that seemed to endure much longer than the folks whose lives gave rise to such stories.

Another assumption that seems to be prevalent in the mind of believers of almost any religions is their deity seems to be passive, or aloof, until invoked by the prayers of the faithful. Oftentimes the believers had to pray long and hard to move the hands of their divine being.
 
## Testimonies on the power of prayer

We often hear stories of parents praying for their children for decades until one day came the good news, the prodigals came home and all praises be to God. And recounts of groups of believers gathered together to pray for someone who had fallen down with some potentially terminal illness. And many more stories told and written through the ages.

There is no doubt God heals and intervenes in the affairs of men, and He treasures the prayers of His saints, He felt every aching heart crying out for redemption, but does He have to wait until someone prays? God loves a sinner more than anyone who might know to pray for him, especially a sinner who has no one to pray for him.

## Examples from the Bible

### Abraham, Lot, and Sodom

Genesis 18 and 19 recorded an event in which fire was sent from heaven to destroy the two great cities of biblical time: Sodom and Gomorrah. Special attention is paid to Sodom as it is the place of residence of the nephew of Lot. In this passage we find Abraham praying for Sodom in the way different than anything we often hear in praying circles. We aren't here to study the form, but to study the unfolding of events leading to Abraham's act of praying.

The story starts out with the Lord's monologue: <em>"Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?"</em> It was God who chose to reveal to Abraham his plan. Abraham was probably going about his daily routines with fleeting thoughts of when he and his beloved would have a child to continue his lineage. Though a child was born unto him through the maid servant Hagar, he and his wife were very likely wondering if God's promise concerning a child of their own was still something to come though it had been a long time since they first heard it.

Up to this point, Abraham wasn't praying about Sodom, and neither was he praying about his nephew Lot, at least not until the Lord revealed his plan to him. And even when he began to pray, his prayer is unlike anything you and I are familiar with.

Abraham didn't pray about Lot. But upon hearing the Lord share his plan to destroy Sodom, he asked:
 <p class="blockquote">“Will You indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? <sup>24</sup>“Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; will You indeed sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it? <sup>25</sup>“Far be it from You to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike. Far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal justly?”</p> 

The Lord answered:

<p class="blockquote">If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place on their account.</p>

Then Abraham proceeded to see how far he can go in numbers of righteous before the Lord would destroy the city. Forty five righteous? Forty? Thirty? Twenty? And finally ten? To each the Lord answered that He wouldn't destroy the city for their sake.

Why wasn't it important for Abraham to intercede for his nephew Lot? Of course it was, but there was something infinitely more important: God's character. As each question was asked with a decreased number of righteous, Abraham felt he knew the Lord a little more. To him, everything else, from Lot, to the city of Sodom, and even to the nagging question in his heart about a promised offspring, and the rest of worldly concern, pales by comparison to the knowledge of God.

Abraham had an expectation of what the God of the universe should be: "Far be it from You to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked." Abraham didn't need to go any further. For now he knew even with one righteous in the city, the Lord would spare it for the sake of one. That is the God that Abraham wanted to know, and to trust. He can trust Him with the fate of Lot and Sodom. From this point on, whatever happens he knew all is well. His world is safe.
