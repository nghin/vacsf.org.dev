What does it mean to "put to death" the deeds of the flesh? There are probably as many different interpretations and applications as there are religions and spiritual beliefs in the world. The deeds of the flesh are generally associated with sinful activities. Therefore to put them to death means to be no longer affected by sinful temptations such as greed, lust, envy, and many other vices.

Is it realistic for Paul to offer such admonition if the most common interpretation is what he has in mind? Can anyone put to death the deeds of the flesh? Has anyone ever done it? It's a resounding no, because no one has ever done it. Then why did Paul bother to offer such admonition if he knew none of his subjects, including himself, will be able to carry it out?
